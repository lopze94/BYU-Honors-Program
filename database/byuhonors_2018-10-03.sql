	(1,'Honors Student Commencement Speaker','','Ashton Omdahl, an August 2018 Honors Graduate, exhibits excellence in every part of his life- not just in academics. ','2018-08-31 22:02:52','<p>Every morning at 5:45 a.m., bleary-eyed but awake nevertheless, Ashton Omdahl rolled out of bed to exercise with the BYU Triathlon club. He didn’t love the early mornings, but he appreciates the discipline they gave him. For Ashton, triathlon, like so many other things at BYU, was merely a balancing act.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAshton served in the Canada Edmonton Mission before heading to BYU, where he began his major in bioinformatics and minors in mathematics and computer science. He participated in the Honors Program and the BYU Triathlon Club, played the violin in the BYU University Orchestra and BYU String Orchestra, and served as president for the Bioinformatics Research Group.\r\nIn 2016, Ashton interned with the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany. On campus, he was a mentored research assistant in Dr. Stephen Piccolo’s Bioinformatics Lab where he designed, constructed, and implemented a computer tool to standardize breast cancer treatment datasets using a standard vocabulary from the National Cancer Institute. His passion is research, but he has more than his fair share of hobbies.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWith so much on his plate, Ashton found himself struggling to balance everything. He said, “For a while at BYU I missed out on social opportunities in exchange for my goals in music, academics, and triathlon. Over time, I learned how to find balance in developing cherished relationships with friends while still pursuing my other goals. Ultimately, for me, it boiled down to what I was most committed to, and that\'s what happened.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor Ashton, the BYU experience was intensely academic, and peppered with what he calls “paradigm-shifting moments” that changed his learning experience at BYU. For him, the Honors Program facilitated such changes. Hl said, “I found a community of people who loved to learn and think deeply and to speak about it articulately and made good friends there. I took classes that changed my perspective on the world and myself and motivated me to live gratefully. I also learned to be confident in myself as a student and a writer. Further, the program provided motivation and a framework for producing worthwhile independent research. So, all together, the Honors experience helped me grow in my intellectual skills, my interpersonal skills, my leadership ability and my desire to serve.”\r\nConcluding his long list of achievements at BYU was Ashton’s graduation with University Honors and speaking at Commencement. Despite his laundry list of academic accomplishments, he cites Honors as the “structured environment” that helped him get familiar with the academic publishing process and show him the power of interdisciplinarity. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“All disciplines add value and are important because they help you see things differently and in a new way,” Ashton said.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn his commencement speech, Ashton shared three truths he gleaned from his time at BYU:\r\n</p>\n<ul>\r\n<li>Fearlessly facing truth about ourselves has the potential to transform our hearts, from sinner to saint.\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Facing the truth, even if very difficult, can expand our secular knowledge.\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Fully facing the inconvenient truth can change how we treat others and treat life in the most essential ways.\r\n</li>\n</ul>\r\n<p>These truths, just a few of the undoubtedly many he gathered during his short time at BYU, pave the way for his future. Up next for Ashton is a PhD in Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins. He hopes his PhD research will drive medical innovations in precision medicine that he could scale-up and help people around the world. When asked why he loved his field, he answered, “Because it’s hard. May seem odd to say, but I love the mental challenge it provides and the potential for solving real-world problems.”\r\nAshton says he’s excited to “go forth and serve” with the knowledge and perspective he gained at BYU. Thinking of the future, he says, “I commit to look forward, facing life’s truths with renewed resolve.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWATCH Ashton’s full commencement address here:\r\n <div class=\"row justify-content-md-center\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xO-5WLQvixE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"https://scontent-lax3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/40455067_10216634131942937_1954168664655659008_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=2c9384ef7a8f93ef93b31cec729244f9&oe=5C2B437E\" alt=\"BYU Excellence Footer\" class=\"img-fluid\">\n','/stories/1/Honors%20Student%20Commencement%20Speaker','/img/stories/6-1535752971671-story-ashton-omdahl.jpg','Read Story','Abigail Norton',0),

For her Leadership Development Experience, she helped create a non-profit educational program for teenagers aged 14-18 in Cambodia called Mitt Chhlat. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMitt Chhlat began as an interdisciplinary team Madison was placed in during her IAS 220 – “Introduction to International Development” class. Her team all had connections to and a passion for helping the people of Cambodia, and they primarily wanted to combat sex trafficking. “I am grateful that the Honors Program has taught me to dig deeper. I could see this horrible problem from the surface, but I knew from my classes that this was a symptom of a much larger problem. There were probably multiple contributing factors, and in order to find an effective solution we needed to discover as many as possible.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<div class=\"row my-3 shadow\">\r\n\r\n<div class=\"col col-12 col-lg-6 px-0 mb-sm-3 mb-md-0\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/30705557_1993366904007671_3121811990008299520_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=6e2022cc9c0961116c6d88e44368e588&oe=5BED6243\" alt=\"Mitt Chhlat Team\" class=\"w-100\">\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"col col-12 col-lg-6 px-4 px-sm-3 px-xl-5 mt-3\">\r\n\r\n<table style=\"height: 100%;\">\r\n\r\n<tbody>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n\r\n<td class=\"align-middle\">\r\n\r\n<h3>Mitt Chhlat Founding Members</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Libby Malone, Madison Allred, Linda Ngyuen, Melody Allred, Meadow Wedekind, Marieka Creek</p>\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n</tbody>\r\n\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs Madison’s team researched sex trafficking in Cambodia, they found many unexpected connections about what contributed to this societal problem. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“As I was researching the issue, I found that one problem led to another. Sex trafficking is accepted in Khmer [Cambodian] society for many reasons, including: the conflicting social expectations of men and women regarding sexually promiscuity and chastity, the legal status and judicial representation available to women, the effects of poverty on family social structure, the general health knowledge and curriculum structure in schools, Cambodia’s neighboring countries, etc. We even found that the genocide coordinated by the Khmer Rouge in the early 1970’s still had a powerful effect on Cambodian society today and had led to the cultivation of a sex trafficking accepting society.” \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nHer team ended up focusing on one key factor- sexual health education. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n“Our group decided that the way we could be the most effective was by creating and implementing a sexual health education curriculum that combats social stigma. From our research, many Khmer teens were lead into prostitution from a lack of education, and men solicited prostitutes not knowing the possible repercussions. We also are designing our curriculum to combat toxic masculinity and empower women in the rising generation.” \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThe team of six decided to call their organization Mitt Chhlat, or “Smart Friend” in Khmer.  The students sought the mentorship of BYU’s International Development instructor and experienced Human Rights lawyer Natalie Romeri-Lewis, who recently taught a Late Summer Honors program course. With Professor Romeri-Lewis’ expertise and guidance, the team of BYU students were able to successfully raise funds and in May-July 2018, conducted a successful pilot program at an orphanage in Phnom Penh. \r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"row my-3 shadow\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"col col-12 col-md-6 px-4 px-sm-3 px-xl-5 mt-3\">\r\n\r\n<table style=\"height: 100%;\">\r\n\r\n<tbody>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n\r\n<td class=\"align-middle\">\r\n\r\n<h3>Mitt Chhlat Pilot Program</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Mitt Chhlat teachers headed to orphanage in Phnom Penh</p>\r\n\r\n</td>\r\n\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n</tbody>\r\n\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col col-12 col-md-6 px-0  mb-md-0 text-right\">\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/33508367_990381911139020_3686781441347158016_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=c5edb5da9a03dfe2b227cff11e1fd1c2&oe=5C2A68D1\" alt=\"Mitt Chhlat Pilot\" class=\"w-100 d-block d-lg-none float-right\">\r\n<img src=\"https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/33508367_990381911139020_3686781441347158016_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=c5edb5da9a03dfe2b227cff11e1fd1c2&oe=5C2A68D1\" alt=\"Mitt Chhlat Pilot\" class=\"w-75 d-none d-lg-block float-right\">\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nCreating Mitt Chhlat and implementing the sexual health curriculum was a perfect fit for Madison’s Leadership Development Experience. \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>She impacted the community by creating jobs for local Cambodians who taught the course and will be future administrators of their organization.  </li>\r\n<li>Madison developed leadership qualities by advocating for the adjustment of curriculum to fit local needs, and her Business Management training aided in several behind the scenes aspects of their organization. </li>\r\n<li>She had to problem solve almost every day as she worked with local stakeholders, several NGO’s, and the Cambodian government. </li>\r\n<li>Madison also developed leadership by collaborating with an interdisciplinary team comprised of Sociology, Political Science, Geography, Public Health, and Mechanical Engineering majors. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Honors has given me the intellectual training I required to reach my goals.

	(6,'Welcome Dr. Dennis Cutchins!','','Meet our new Associate Director!','2018-08-03 14:30:19','<p><i>The Honors Program welcomes Dr. Dennis Cutchins as the new Associate Director of the Program.</i></p>\n<p>\r\nDr. Dennis Cutchins knows exactly what book he would bring if he were stranded on a desert island. Herman Melville’s magnum opus, “Moby Dick.” “Every time I read it I find new stuff in it,” he said. “It’s actually a really cool, rich book that you could read multiple times and still get something out of.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA trip to Cutchins’ office would lead you to believe he’s taken Melville’s words, “I try all things, I achieve what I can,” to heart. His office walls are lined with thousands of books, from Native American History to hefty anthologies, plus a sizeable stack of VHS tapes, and DVDs. In the first five minutes of chatting with Dennis he showed me his collection of vintage toys: Planet of the Apes, a Borg Ship, and handheld video games to name a few, plus a Freddie Mercury painting that launched him into a rendition of Queen’s “I Want To Break Free.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCutchins’ lightheartedness and insightful nature are just some of the things he’ll bring to the table when he officially steps into his role as Associate Director of the Honors Program this fall. He is a self-proclaimed “learning nerd” who hopes to draw students to the program with his big vision for program development.  \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOne of Cutchins’ plans is to continue to foster the interdisciplinary environment of the Honors Program. “My natural inclination is toward interdisciplinarity,” he said.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCutchins has spent the greater part of his career steeped in interdisciplinary research. He specializes in Adaptation Studies, which combines film and literature and history. As a child, Cutchins vividly remembers watching a cartoon adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Hobbit” and being disappointed. “From a fairly early age I realized that there was a relationship there and that it was complicated,” he said.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA study of that relationship, what is now known as Adaptation Studies, came into being during Cutchins’ career. “It fun to get in on the ground floor,” he said. Since the start of his career, Cutchins has published dozens of papers and contributed to multiple books on the subject.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nGoing forward, Cutchins also hopes to draw in students from across the university. “I would love to see Honors arts students hanging out with Honors engineering students and figuring out ways to do projects together,” he said. In Winter 2019, Cutchins is slated to teach an Honors Unexpected Connections course alongside microbiology and molecular biology professor Dr. Brian M. Poole. These classes are aimed at helping students see connections between opposing disciplines. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCutchins hopes to attract other “learning nerds” to the Honors Program and offers the following advice to anyone considering enrolling: “If you want to be in a place surrounded by the most innovative professors, the most innovative students, and the most inspiring learners, it’s Honors.”\r\n</p>','/stories/6/Welcome%20Dr.%20Dennis%20Cutchins!','/img/stories/1-1536006619062-story-dennis-cutchins.jpg','Read Story','Abigail Norton',4),

Students had the chance to chat with Dr. Kate Johnson, Assistant Professor of Mathematics Education. Johnson’s topic for the event was relationship of identity (racial, gender, class) and mathematics. \n</p><p>\nJohnson started out the presentation by distributing packets filled with word problems to all of the participants. After giving everyone a couple minutes to solve the problems, Johnson gathered the group and began to discuss their real-world application. If there’s anything Johnson can do it’s discuss math and why it’s significant.\n</p><p>\nThe best part of the event was the opportunity to ask Johnson questions and gain an understanding of what she does on a daily basis. While not everyone is a STEM major, Chocolate Milk Discussions can help open your eyes to the importance of other disciplines in your life.\n</p><p>\nChocolate Milk Discussion is held every Friday and everyone is invited to come. This event gives students the chance to interact with professors and learn about their field of research in an informal atmosphere and enjoy BYU’s legendary chocolate milk.\n</p><p>\nDr. Kate Johnson did her Bachelor of Science in Mathematics at Miami University in Ohio. She later completed her Master of Education at the University of Pittsburgh, School of Education in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Johnson wrote her Master’s thesis on: Education of Students Who Are Deaf and Hard of Hearing.

	(10,'The Germ of an Idea','','Explore Connections in HONRS 220.','2018-10-02 11:50:07','<p>\r\nThe interdisciplinary thinking the BYU Honors Program strives to cultivate in its students and faculty is exemplified in our HONRS 200 level classes - the Unexpected Connections courses. Classes are team-taught by professors from two different disciplines who choose their section’s unique focus and curriculum. Students are able to engage in an exceptional interdisciplinary learning environment and make unexpected connections of their own during the course. </i>\r\n<p>\r\nOne of our Honors Unexpected Courses this Fall Semester, team-taught by Dr. Dennis Cutchins and Dr. Brian Poole, is titled “The Germ of an Idea: Disease and Literature.” The course is based upon the idea that disease has molded human behavior as well as human culture, and combines the GE Biology & Letters courses.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n “The basic gist of the class is recognizing that disease has had a surprising and long term and endemic effect on culture and literature. It is surprising to see how some of the best Operas, like La Boheme or La Traviata were written about disease. Or that some of the best poets like Keats or Shelley were inspired by disease. We even talk about how our notions of what’s beautiful or what our definition of horror is, like Poe, are often influenced by disease,” said Dr. Cutchins, Associate Director of the Honors Program. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen talking about the class, Dr. Poole said, “I think that’s a huge part of it, disease’s effect on culture. We also talk about a couple of times when disease almost wipes out cultures with the Native Americans and the Black Plague, it has these radical effects on culture, art and literature. We spend the second part of the class talking about disease and humanity, and the ‘other’, how you define yourself and other people. We read these really awesome zombie books that address that question really well. If you have a disease, are you considered subhuman?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe class headed to the Life Science Building on a Friday morning to participate in a lab experiment: gram staining bacteria. Students tested whether their bacteria was gram positive or negative, and how the results of their experiment can lead to information on what antibiotics would be needed to treat the bacteria. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nAll of the bacteria was grown by Dr. Poole, and students took photos of their final products. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <div id=\"carouselBacteria\" class=\"carousel slide\" data-ride=\"carousel\">\r\n  <ol class=\"carousel-indicators\">\r\n    <li data-target=\"#carouselBacteria\" data-slide-to=\"0\" class=\"active\"></li>\r\n    <li data-target=\"#carouselBacteria\" data-slide-to=\"1\"></li>\r\n    <li data-target=\"#carouselBacteria\" data-slide-to=\"2\"></li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <div class=\"carousel-inner\">\r\n    <div class=\"carousel-item active\">\r\n      <img class=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/img/stories/germ-story/bac1.jpg\" alt=\"First slide\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"carousel-item\">\r\n      <img class=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/img/stories/germ-story/bac2.jpg\" alt=\"Second slide\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"carousel-item\">\r\n      <img class=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/img/stories/germ-story/bac3.jpg\" alt=\"Third slide\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <a class=\"carousel-control-prev\" href=\"#carouselBacteria\" role=\"button\" data-slide=\"prev\">\r\n    <span class=\"carousel-control-prev-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>\r\n    <span class=\"sr-only\">Previous</span>\r\n  </a>\r\n  <a class=\"carousel-control-next\" href=\"#carouselBacteria\" role=\"button\" data-slide=\"next\">\r\n    <span class=\"carousel-control-next-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>\r\n    <span class=\"sr-only\">Next</span>\r\n  </a>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nRio Turnbull, a senior in the English program noted, “Biology has always been my least favorite subject in school, and so I always knew that doing the biology GE requirement at BYU wouldn’t be so great… it would be difficult and I wouldn’t be very good at it. But that’s part of the reason I knew the Honors courses would be enjoyable to me because I knew it would make it a little more palatable even though the Biology aspects are slightly difficult and less appealing to me. It’s tempered really well with how broad their objectives are and also the different topics we explore. It makes Biology seem more relevant to me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDrs. Cutchins and Poole also see the influence of their topic in pop culture and its importance in current events. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“We’ve talked about the tuberculosis quarantine situations in Russia. They’ve been in there so long, and they will never get out… Can you really make a difference between being in prison versus being in quarantine for the rest of your life? The reason that this is happening to them isn’t that they were bad or breaking the law, it’s because they got a disease. We think zombie literature and movies have been so popular over the past twenty years due to people’s concerns about healthcare. It’s not surprising that in the time the zombie movies have been rising, there have been increasing fears and increasing realities of pandemics, and that in most of the zombie movies or narratives, disease plays a huge role,” said Dr. Cutchins.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDr. Poole asked, “With all these movies you are destroying these zombies and you’ve got the wall and everything, but what if they aren’t really just zombies and they are just sick people? What are you doing? What message are you sending?” \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <div id=\"carouselStudents\" class=\"carousel slide\" data-ride=\"carousel\">\r\n  <ol class=\"carousel-indicators\">\r\n    <li data-target=\"#carouselStudents\" data-slide-to=\"0\" class=\"active\"></li>\r\n    <li data-target=\"#carouselStudents\" data-slide-to=\"1\"></li>\r\n    <li data-target=\"#carouselStudents\" data-slide-to=\"2\"></li>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <div class=\"carousel-inner\">\r\n    <div class=\"carousel-item active\">\r\n      <img class=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/img/stories/germ-story/students1.jpg\" alt=\"First slide\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"carousel-item\">\r\n      <img class=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/img/stories/germ-story/students2.jpg\" alt=\"Second slide\">\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"carousel-item\">\r\n      <img class=\"d-block w-100\" src=\"/img/stories/germ-story/students3.jpg\" alt=\"Third slide\">\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <a class=\"carousel-control-prev\" href=\"#carouselStudents\" role=\"button\" data-slide=\"prev\">\r\n    <span class=\"carousel-control-prev-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>\r\n    <span class=\"sr-only\">Previous</span>\r\n  </a>\r\n  <a class=\"carousel-control-next\" href=\"#carouselStudents\" role=\"button\" data-slide=\"next\">\r\n    <span class=\"carousel-control-next-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span>\r\n    <span class=\"sr-only\">Next</span>\r\n  </a>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJohnny Bigelow, a senior in Strategic Management said, “I love the opportunity I have to think in ways I’ve never considered before. I take honors classes because the content, comments and assignments usually let me grow in ways I’ve never tried.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the most important aspects of the Unexpected Connections courses is the focus on developing critical thinking skills as well as honing student’s problem solving abilities in an interdisciplinary way. Drs. Cutchins and Poole accomplish this through one of their midterms. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“We give three tests in the class, and the second test is a problem solving test. We come up with a situation, bring it to class, and the class has to solve it with the principles that they’ve learned. The first [semester we taught this course] we were trying to solve a small-pox outbreak among the American Indians in the 1830’s,” Dr. Poole said. “For the second class we hypothesized a killer influenza outbreak at BYU, and how every aspect of the people here: the administration, and the police, the health services, would have to deal with that. [Students had to examine] how it would affect the people here, and how they would have to respond.” \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDr. Cutchins added, “We’ll have another problem for the students to solve this semester, and we are excited to come up with it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis course is a result of successful collaboration between Drs. Cutchins and Poole, and has been an Honors student favorite over the past three years. “They are quite the dynamic duo- it makes class engaging and I highly recommend it,” added Rio Turnbull.\r\n</p>\r\n\n','/stories/10/The%20Germ%20of%20an%20Idea','/img/stories/1-1538157006927-story-germ-idea.jpg','Read More','Madison Allred',2),

He was anxious to go mountain biking...','2018-10-01 15:01:37','<p>\nIt was a sunny Saturday in 2011 and Dr. Troy Cox\'s chores were done. He was anxious to go mountain biking. \n</p>\n<p>\nOn the trail, he began the long-awaited climb up a well-worn path. That\'s when his heart started racing, and he couldn\'t catch his breath. Then the first cyclist passed him. Heart still racing, he forged on. Then a second person, creeping up behind, then passing him. Heart pounding, Dr. Cox pedaled and watched as a hiker passed him. Something was wrong. He peered down at the heart rate monitor on his bike. The read: 220 BPM. Dr. Cox thinks to say a prayer and the answer is clear, go home. Back at home, Dr. Cox lays on his bed, heart still pounding. He knows he needs to go to the hospital. Several hours later he\'s diagnosed with atrial fibrillation: an irregular and rapid heart rate that occurs when the heart\'s two upper chambers beat out of coordination with the two lower chambers.\n</p>\n<p>\nDr. Cox acknowledged how frightening the experience was during his September Disciple Scholar lecture, \"Tailwinds and Headwinds: Stretching Yourself Both Spiritually and Academically.\" Dr. Cox is an Assistant Professor of Linguistics and the Associate Director of the Center for Language Studies. He is passionate about language, learning, and cycling – three unifying themes during his lecture. Dr. Cox also discussed the ILR Scale or ACTFL Proficiency guidelines for language and how they relate to life.\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring a recent ride up Hobble Creek Canyon, Dr. Cox was amazed at how easy the ride was. That\'s when he felt the tailwind, propelling him forward. He says he was grateful for the tailwind, even when he didn\'t recognize it was there. However, Dr. Cox acknowledges there aren\'t always tailwinds to push us forward. In fact, many times there are headwinds pushing us back. Dr. Cox\'s frightening encounter with atrial fibrillation was a reminder for him of the headwinds we encounter in life and how they shape us. \n</p>\n<p>\n The effects of headwinds are vast, and include many of the following:  \n<ul>\n<li>Our performance is worse than our true ability</li>\n<li>We can underestimate our true ability</li>\n<li>We might feel the universe is against us</li>\n<li>We confuse performance and proficiency</li>\n<li>We might quit</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<p>\nDr. Cox compared headwinds to making progress in learning a foreign language. \"Awkward and ugly are part of the process,\" he said. Yet, the opposition can result in growth with deliberate practice. Dr. Cox urged attendees to push through the headwinds and utilize the resources we have to overcome obstacles that may stand in our way. \"If we actually outride the wind we can create a headwind,\" said Dr. Cox.\n</p>\n<p>\nDr. Cox is married and is the proud father of Cameron, Hannah, and Millie. When he isn\'t cycling, practicing yoga, experimenting in the kitchen or with a camera, you can find him in his office where he works with graduate students and colleagues conducting research in language testing, language acquisition, self-assessment, and objective measurement.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn 1994, Dr. Cox graduated cum laude from Brigham Young University with a BA in Linguistics. He received his MA in Teaching English as a Second Language from BYU and completed his Master\'s Thesis on \"The effect of prequestions, proficiency level and passage length on listening comprehension test scores.\" Dr. Cox went on to earn his Ph.D. in Instructional Psychology and Technology from BYU. He wrote his Dissertation on \"Investigating prompt difficulty in an automatically scored speaking performance assessment.\"\n</p>\n','/stories/11/Tailwinds%20and%20Headwinds','/img/stories/1-1538427697224-story-troy_cox.jpg','Read More','Abigail Norton',0);
