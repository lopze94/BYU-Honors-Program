I love to write and the personal essay was something I had never really explored, so it was fun to experiment and learn with a new genre. Honors 320 was one of the most challenging classes I've taken at BYU, but I think it taught me more about myself and about my abilities as a writer than any other class. The effort was all worthwhile, though - I'm super proud of my final essay!</br> <br><b>Plan after Graduation:</b> I've applied to both BYU and UofU for their MS in Speech-Language Pathology programs. Both are great schools and I'd be happy to be accepted to either one, although personally, I'm hoping to go to the U.</br>",
