            Karl G. Maeser was born to Johann Gottfried and Federicka Zocher Maeser in 1828. Maeser’s intellect did not go unnoticed by his parents, who determined to set him on a path to greatness.

            In 1845, at the age of 17, Maeser found himself disillusioned with the elitism and abstraction of one of the most prestigious schools in Dresden. He transferred to the teaching-training college in Friedrichstadt. Maeser’s teacher college program fostered
            a core belief that a whole education requires development of the rational powers, physical capacities, and moral disposition.

            Ten years later, then a respected schoolteacher and professor at Dresden’s Budich Institute, 27-year-old Maeser found Moritz Busch’s newly published work Die Mormonen: ihr Prophet, ihr Staat und ihr Glaube (The Mormons: Their Prophet, Their State, and
            Their Faith). Busch’s unabashed misgivings about the Mormon church ignited Maeser’s curiosity to learn for himself the truthfulness of Mormonism.

            Without Mormons or missionaries in Saxony, there were no available Church materials. Despite the fear of severe repercussions from the government Maeser sent an enthusiastic letter to the mission president of the Swiss, French, Italian, and German Mission.
            When formal correspondence began in August 1855, Maeser couldn’t get the answers and materials fast enough. Sunday, October 14, Maeser and two others were baptized under the protection of darkness. A week later a branch was formed in the Maeser
            home with eight new members, including Karl and his wife, Anna. However, six months later the police discovered the secret congregation, and Maeser was arrested.

            It wasn’t until 1860, with the Maesers in America, that there were able to join a wagon train to Salt Lake. When they arrived, Karl expected to conduct seminars, teach courses on Greek and Latin, and delve into scientific theories. Instead, he found himself
            teaching at several schools and collecting tuition in turnips and pumpkins.

            In 1876, the academy where Maeser was established as principal, was damaged by a nearby attack. Karl sought his bishop who happened to be meeting with Prophet Brigham Young. When the prophet heard about the damage he said, “Brother Maeser; I have another
            mission for you…We want you to go to Provo to organize and conduct an Academy to be established in the name of the Church.”

            BYU Academy became the foundation for establishing multiple Church academies.

            Over the course of his time as a teacher, leader, and administrator, Maeser trained thousands of teachers and helped found over fifty schools, seven of which are now institutions of higher education (Brigham Young University Provo, Brigham Young University
            Idaho, LDS Business College, Weber State University, Snow College, Dixie State University, and Eastern Arizona College).
