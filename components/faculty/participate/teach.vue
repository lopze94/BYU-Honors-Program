        <h3>Honors Core: Unexpected Connections</h3>
        <p>
            The Unexpected Connections courses comprise the core of the Honors Program curriculum. Each team-taught course explores a
            unique topic and interrogates big or "great" questions through two distinct disciplinary lenses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Courses intentionally combine seemingly unrelated fields to explore the tension and connections between ideas, methodologies,
            and insights. Students and faculty learn together in a collaborative, innovative environment to discover unexpected
            connections between disciplines, leading to a deeper understanding of the questions we seek to answer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each course simultaneously fills Honors core curriculum requirements and the GE requirements in two designated disciplines.

        <h3>HONRS 120: Introduction to Great Questions</h3>
        <p>
            Each semester, a series of guest faculty presenters introduce students to the methodologies and questions that drive research
            in a variety of disciplines. Faculty guests help students recognize and articulate basic thinking patters, identify
            research questions, and look for interdisciplinary connections to other fields.
        </p>
        <h3>Late Summer Honors</h3>
        <p>
            The Late Summer Honors program allows incoming freshmen to participate in a one-week intensive Honors experience just prior
            to fall semester. Students enroll in a one-credit Honors seminar taught in a subject of the faculty member’s
            choice. We especially welcome course proposals from full-time faculty that introduce students to great questions,
            and/or an interdisciplinary approach to answering those questions. Team instructors/proposals are welcome!
        </p>
        <h3>
            Alcuin Fellowship
        </h3>
        <p>
            Awarded by Undergraduate Education, the Alcuin fellowship recognizes proven excellence in teaching, willingness to pursue
            interdisciplinary education and potential to create exceptional educational experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alcuin Fellows are an integral part of the Honors Program where they have unique opportunities to learn from each other,
            socialize with top university instructors and participate in teaching development activities. In addition to
            teaching in the Unexpected Connections sequence, Fellows participate in Honors Program events, mentor Honors’
            students, and facilitate interdisciplinary research. Candidates must be full-time professorial faculty with at
            least five years’ experience at BYU. Continuing faculty status is highly recommended.
