    Every semester, students pour hundreds of glasses of chocolate milk during weekly
    Chocolate Milk Discussions in the Honors Reading Room. Without the influence of the Honors
    Student Leadership Council, events like Chocolate Milk Discussions, Disciple Scholar Lectures,
    and the annual Murder Mystery party, would not exist.
</p>
<p>
    The council is a team of students from disciplines across campus with a common goal: to
    be the voice of Honors students. Members of HSLC must be Honors students and commit to two
    semesters on the team. Students spend time developing leadership skills, planning events,
    conducting research, and brainstorming ways to improve and enhance the Honors experience.
    HSLC members are passionate about the Honors Program and sharing their experience with
    others.

<p>
    The program would not be possible without the leadership of Vika Filimoeatu. Vika
    oversees everything, attends events, and comes up with amazing ideas. She’s what makes HSLC
    run.
