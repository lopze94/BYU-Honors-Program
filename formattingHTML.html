<p>In Honors 120, students are privileged to hear from many excellent professors from across campus who are exploring
    Great Questions. These select faculty introduce students to the methodologies, research questions and thinking
    patterns unique to their disciplines. We think of these faculty as our Honors Program superheroes! They
    consistently serve the Honors and campus communities and are committed to academic excellence and interdisciplinary
    thinking.</p>

<!-- New comment -->

<p>When Dr. Julie Crockett was a kid she attended a basketball camp at BYU. For meals, they ate in the Cannon Center,
    where they were overwhelmed by the number of options. During one meal, Dr. Crockett’s friend told her they were
    stuffed, but they wanted to keep eating. The friend inquired of Dr. Crockett, “How do I do it?” She quickly found
    the solution, and replied, “Pretend you aren’t full!” Having heeded her advice, her friend was sick for the rest of
    the day. But Dr. Crockett had found a solution to a difficult problem. </p><p>Years later, Dr. Crockett
    encourages students to problem solve in engineering, as well as in life. Her advice is to:<ul><li>Break down
            problems</li><li>Be consistent</li><li>Utilize a variety of methods</li><li>Bear testimony</li></ul></p><p>When
    it comes to being consistent, Dr. Crockett emphasizes the importance of being committed to daily, weekly, and
    monthly actions. Consistent participation in these actions, whether it’s scripture study, church attendance, or
    temple attendance, allows regular inspiration. However, Dr. Crockett notes that some solutions take time. As we
    strive to do good and improve our lives, Dr. Crockett offers the following scripture, Doctrine and Covenants 64:33,
    as encouragement. “Wherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work. And out
    of small things proceedeth that which is great.”</p><p>Dr. Crockett also knows the importance of utilizing a
    variety of methods. She knew she wanted to go to graduate school but wasn’t sure where she wanted to go. After
    narrowing her search to University of California, San Diego and Berkeley she decided to pray about both. But Dr.
    Crockett’s prayers didn’t produce an answer. She knew she had one thing left to try. She went and visited both
    campuses to see which was right for her. What she found were two very different atmospheres. That’s when she had
    her answer. </p><p>Bearing testimony is an important aspect of problem-solving. Sharing truth and knowledge
    promotes further truth and knowledge. It also allows us to openly discuss topics we do and do not understand. For
    Dr. Crockett, this meant sharing with her college volleyball team and coach why she would not play on Sundays. She
    was able to bear testimony of something that was important to her and learn more about that importance for herself.
    </p><p>Dr. Crockett is an associate professor of mechanical engineering. She was the first full-time female
    faculty member in the College of Engineering – a daunting position. She has come to be a valued and productive
    member of the Mechanical Engineering faculty and popular with students. </p><p>In 2002, Dr. Crockett
    graduated with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Denver. In 2004 she was awarded her M.S. in
    Engineering Sciences from University of California, San Diego. Only a few years later she received her Ph.D. in
    Engineering Sciences from the University of California, San Diego.</p>
